TODO:
    Make the help option print out useful information or decide if that is even needed.
    Make a Utils program to contain random assortec functions in piece.py
    Implement check and checkmate:
        To do this look into implementing "vision" for the king piece to determine
        if a piece if checking it.
    After implementing check have find_moves() check if moves are valid
    IE: Make a new board and check if the move results in the current player's king being in check.
    This is just to make sure that one doesn't make a move that results in them checking themself.
    Add a way of taking in a file or string and converting it into a board (Allows saving game)


Check Implementation Checklist:
    Give both kings vision to see if they are in check
    Make it so that the determinant for the game to continue is if the current player has at least
    1 valid move. No moves means it is either a draw or currently player is checkmated.
    Have every checked move have to determine if it'd put the current player in checkmate.
