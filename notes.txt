TODO:
See if there are any other configs to add and implement them.
Make the help option print out useful information or decide if that is even needed.
Implement check and checkmate:
	To do this look into implementing "vision" for the king piece to determine
	if a piece if checking it. 
After implementing check have find_moves() check if moves are valid 
IE: Make a new board and check if the move results in the current player's king being in check.
This is just to make sure that one doesn't make a move that results in them checking themself.
